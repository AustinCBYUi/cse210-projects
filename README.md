Austin Campbell will be authoring beyond the template for this class!

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows: Fyi, I wouldn't exactly call them starter codes, maybe started files.. :)

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
* `final` - Starter projects for final project.
